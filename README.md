# dog-vs-cat-classification
This study will delve into an image classification task that aims to build and train a model that can identify between dog and cat images.
The development of deep learning technologies has provided endless opportunities to aid in real world scenarios. The dataset of thousands of labeled images would be examined and preprocessed to prepare them for the model. A convolutional neural network would be created and trained, and performance will be compared through validation accuracy and validation loss. Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized deep learning algorithm designed for object recognition. This knowledge is significant in situations like when shelters need automated pet organizing or when pet-specific applications are aiming to develop their user experience. This notebook will go through the exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure, model building and training, discussion, and conclusion. The data is sourced from Kaggle [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition)
